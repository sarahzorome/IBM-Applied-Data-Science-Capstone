# ðŸš€ Applied Data Science Capstone: _Winning the Space Race with Data Science_
This capstone project is the 10th and final course of the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science?utm_medium=sem&utm_source=gg&utm_campaign=B2C_NAMER_ibm-data-science_ibm_FTCOF_professional-certificates_country-US-country-CA&campaignid=1876641588&adgroupid=70740725700&device=c&keyword=ibm%20data%20science%20professional%20certificate&matchtype=b&network=g&devicemodel=&adposition=&creativeid=634520636552&hide_mobile_promo&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI35nx4OXugQMVSFFyCh0xjw3IEAAYASAAEgLSs_D_BwE).

## ðŸ“š Project Background

SpaceX is the most successful company of the commercial space age, making space travel affordable. The company advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. Based on public information and machine learning models, we are going to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.

## ðŸ’» My Role
I assumed the role of a Data Scientist working for a startup intending to compete with SpaceX. My main task was to use my findings and models to predict if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket would land successfully. In the process, I followed the Data Science methodology involving data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reported my results to stakeholders via a final presentation.
